I am currently a Ph.D student at the University of Tennessee, advised by Theodora Bourni. I previously completed my M.Math from the University of Edinburgh, graduating in 2020. 

During the Fall semester of 2024, I spent a month as a program associate for the program "_New Frontiers in Curvature: Flows, General Relativity, Minimal Submanifolds, and Symmetry_" at the SLMath (formerly the MSRI). I also spent a week during the spring of 2025 as an academic visitor of the Australian National University.

My Research Interests
======
My research lies in the subject of geometric analysis. The focus of my research thus far has been on various geometric evolution equations, which is a topic of study which lies firmly in the intersection between differential geometry and partial differential equations. My thesis work in particular centers around the _free boundary curve shortening flow_; my work in this direction constitutes a comprehensive classification of its ancient solutions, that is, solutions that exists forever backwards in time. 

UTK Geometric Analysis Seminar
======
I am co-organizing the geometric analysis seminar at the University of Tennessee for the 2025-2026 academic year. Details of past and future talks may be found here.

Outside Academia
======
Outside of my academic endeavors, I enjoy the sport of curling.
