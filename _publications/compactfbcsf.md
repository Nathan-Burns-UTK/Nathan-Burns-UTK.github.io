In this paper, we classify the convex ancient solutions to the free boundary curve shortening flow which lie inside convex and compact regions. Existence is proven by taking a limit of flows which exist for longer and longer periods of time, and uniqueness is proven by explicitely computing the backwards limit of an exponentially scaled height function which turns out to be independent of such an ancient solution.
